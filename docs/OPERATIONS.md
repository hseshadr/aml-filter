# Security, privacy, reliability, and performance contract

**TL;DR.** AML-Filter is a static site with two trust domains: public signed
watchlist/model bytes arrive from the same-origin CDN, while customer names and review
data stay inside the browser. A release is blocked if signed data can roll back, typed
queries make a network request, customer deletion leaves review history behind, any
operation is unbounded, or the deployed site cannot prove its exact Git commit.

## Threat and privacy data flow

| Data | Path and storage | Retention / deletion | Network and logs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Signed watchlists and list vectors | Cloudflare Pages → verified Worker → content-addressed OPFS cache | Replaced by monotonic signed publishes; **Clear cached lists** deletes the public-data cache | Same-origin GET only; public, never PII |
| Embedding model and ORT runtime | Same-origin immutable assets → browser cache / memory | Browser cache policy; user can clear site data | Same-origin GET only; no Hugging Face/jsDelivr fallback |
| Typed screening query | Input → ephemeral worker embedding → score | Not persisted by `/screen`; query vector is ephemeral | **Zero requests while typing/scoring** and no query text in console output, enforced by C1 Chromium |
| Customer profile, DOB, identifiers | UI → SQLite-WASM on origin-private OPFS | Local until explicit customer deletion or browser-site-data deletion | No application API, telemetry, prompt, or provider path |
| Matches, reviewer identity, notes, audit events | Same local SQLite database | Lifecycle writes are append-only; customer deletion atomically erases matches, reviewer data, and events | No application API or telemetry; C1 asserts screened names do not appear in console output |
| Settings | Same local SQLite database | Until changed or browser-site-data deletion; deleting one customer does not erase global settings | No application API or telemetry |

There is no generative-AI prompt path, account service, server database, analytics SDK,
export, cloud backup, or restore service. That is a product constraint, not an omitted
roadmap promise. Clearing browser site data is the only all-data reset and has no remote
recovery. The operator must not describe this local demo as backed up or centrally
recoverable.

### Trust boundaries and adversaries

- **CDN or cache serves hostile/stale bytes.** The browser verifies the Ed25519 pointer,
  its required monotonic `sequence`, the manifest content address, every compressed
  chunk, and every reassembled file before parsing or promotion. Missing/stale sequence,
  signature failure, hash failure, rollback, and an equal-sequence/different-pointer
  collision all fail closed before downstream fetch or promotion.
- **A stale deploy reports success.** Each workflow writes the checked-out 40-character
  Git SHA and GitHub run id to `build.json`, deploys it with the app, then polls the real
  domain until that exact identity is served. A no-op/stale Pages deploy fails.
- **Origin or network stalls.** Each fetch aborts after 15 seconds. Only a typed
  network-unreachable failure may use an already verified active cache; integrity
  failures never fall back.
- **Storage is small/corrupt or a write is interrupted.** Sync checks reported quota,
  validates cached bytes on read, evicts zero-byte/poisoned chunks, and refetches them on
  retry. Database migrations and privacy deletion are transactions.
- **Two tabs sync or clear concurrently.** Web Locks let syncs stage CAS bytes together,
  serialize the final active-pointer re-check/promotion, and make clear exclusive. Every
  acquisition aborts after 10 seconds with a typed retryable error; the UI surfaces the
  existing Retry path instead of waiting forever on a stalled tab. Missing Web Locks is
  detected before boot and is unsupported, not silently unsafe.
- **Large lists exhaust the tab.** Chunk fetches use an eight-worker queue; the real-list
  directory renders 24 cards per page; the vector matrix is a single row-major
  `Float32Array` transferred across worker boundaries instead of cloned.
- **Supply chain or key exposure.** Runtime dependencies are lockfile-pinned, the model
  and staged WASM assets are SHA-256/size checked, the signing seed exists only as a
  GitHub secret, dependency audit has no ignore list, and gitleaks scans full history.

## Numeric SLA and resource budgets

These are engineering-demo bounds, not a hosted compliance-service availability SLA.
They are fixed in tests before measurement.

| Workload | Budget | Enforcement |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| One bundle/model fetch | ≤ 15 s | `FETCH_TIMEOUT_MS` + abort test |
| Cross-tab store-lock acquisition | ≤ 10 s | abortable Web Locks regression tests |
| Model load | ≤ 120 s | `MODEL_LOAD_TIMEOUT_MS` + never-settles/retry tests |
| Whole cold boot | ≤ 180 s (C1 uses a tighter 160 s vote) | runtime timeout + minified Chromium |
| Warm typed query through rendered result | ≤ 10 s | minified Chromium C1 |
| Exact top-10 retrieval, 31,348 × 384 | p50 ≤ 500 ms; p95 ≤ 1,000 ms | repeatable 20-run Vitest performance contract |
| Vector matrix, 31,348 × 384 | ≤ 50 MiB | realistic performance contract (actual 48,150,528 B) |
| Directory DOM | ≤ 24 dossier cards; < 2,000 total nodes in C1 | 31,348-row unit fixture + Chromium |
| Post-boot JavaScript heap | < 512 MiB where Chromium exposes the metric | C1 Chromium |
| Chunk download fan-out | ≤ 8 requests | concurrency regression test |
| Model requests per cold boot | exactly 1 | C1 Chromium |
| Query-time and third-party requests | exactly 0 | C1 Chromium network boundary assertion |
| One static asset | < 25 MiB | Cloudflare Pages asset preflight |

Local reference measurement on 2026-07-15 (macOS arm64, Node 25.2.1) for the realistic
31,348 × 384 exact scan: **p50 10.2 ms, p95 18.1 ms**, 48,150,528-byte matrix.
Reproduce it:

```bash
cd frontend/packages/amlfilter-browser
pnpm exec vitest run src/engine/vectorIndex.performance.test.ts --reporter=verbose --silent=false
```

The production browser p50/p95 and exact cold/warm timings must be recorded after deploy;
the hard local bounds prevent a regression from shipping, but they are not a substitute
for real-domain measurement.

## Recovery contract

- **Offline after a verified boot:** use the verified OPFS active bundle and browser-cached
  model; the bundle lane proves reload and screening with the network unavailable.
- **Corrupt/partial chunk:** fail the current read, evict it, then refetch on Retry. Never
  present an empty list as a clear result.
- **Bad signature/hash/rollback:** stop. Do not use the incoming bundle and do not replace
  the last verified active pointer.
- **Boot timeout:** show a visible alert and working Retry; memoized failed boot state is
  cleared so Retry performs real work.
- **Store-lock timeout:** close a stale AML-Filter tab and Retry. A timed-out request does
  not enter its critical section or mutate the active pointer.
- **Database contention:** eight bounded acquisition attempts with 50–800 ms backoff.
- **Browser storage loss:** there is no cloud backup. Recovery point is the last committed
  local SQLite transaction while OPFS survives; if the origin's site data is cleared,
  customer data is unrecoverable by design.

## Supported browser baseline

Production support covers the current and previous desktop releases of Chrome, Edge,
Firefox, and Safari 17+. A secure context must provide module Workers, OPFS, WebCrypto,
and Web Locks. Mobile browsers and embedded WebViews are outside the release contract;
feature detection blocks them cleanly when a required primitive is absent.

## Release and production runbook

1. Run `cd frontend && pnpm gate` on the exact commit (coverage, build, i18n, three
   real-Chromium lanes). Run the scheduled dependency/secret audits too.
2. Deploy only after CI succeeds. The workflow rebuilds and verifies the real signed
   bundle, stamps `build.json`, deploys, and rejects a stale exact-identity check.
3. On `https://aml-filter.com`, verify `build.json`, CSP, no wildcard CORS,
   `public.key` MIME/revalidation, `latest` no-store, immutable manifest/chunk caching,
   real 404, clean console/network, and mobile + desktop screening.
4. Verify `www` permanently redirects to the canonical apex with path and query intact.
5. Record cold/warm p50/p95, request counts, heap/DOM bounds, and the exact deployed SHA.
   Until this real-domain evidence passes, the release is not Northstar.
