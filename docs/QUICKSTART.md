# Quickstart

aml-filter is a **zero-server, in-browser** watchlist-filtering and KYC-review app: a
static React SPA that syncs a **signed catalog of sanctions lists** (OFAC, EU, UN,
UK/OFSI) into the tab and screens names locally — embedding, search, and the explainable
scorer all run in the browser. No server-side database or service to provision; private
customer state uses local SQLite-WASM on OPFS.

Clone → install → run → screen a name → work it in the review board. About **ten
minutes**, most of it the first run fetching the ~23 MB embedding-model weights.

The repository is public and MIT-licensed:
<https://github.com/hseshadr/aml-filter>. No account, key, or collaborator access is
needed to clone it and run everything below.

> Reminder: aml-filter is a portfolio demo, **not** a compliance product. See
> [`../NOTICE`](../NOTICE).

## Prerequisites

- **Node 22.13.0** (see [`../frontend/.nvmrc`](../frontend/.nvmrc); `nvm use` picks it
  up). Any Node ≥ 22.13 runs the app; the `pnpm gate` step below additionally requires
  the exact `.nvmrc` version, because that is what CI runs.
- **pnpm** (`corepack enable` provides the pinned version)
- **Internet access on the first run** — the first `dev` or `build` downloads the
  MiniLM embedding weights (~23 MB, SHA-256-pinned) into `frontend/app/public/models/`
  so the browser never fetches a model from a CDN at runtime. Every later run reuses
  them; the app itself is fully offline-capable once they are on disk.
- **A supported desktop browser** — current or previous Chrome, Edge, Firefox, or
  Safari 17+, with module Workers, OPFS, WebCrypto, and Web Locks enabled

That's the whole list. There is no backend, database, API key, or account to set up.

## 1. Clone, install, run

All commands run from `frontend/` — there is no root `package.json`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hseshadr/aml-filter.git
cd aml-filter/frontend
corepack enable                       # provides the pnpm version pinned in package.json
pnpm install
pnpm --filter aml-filter-app dev      # stages the model weights, then starts Vite
```

The first `dev` run stages three things before Vite starts — the MiniLM weights, the
onnxruntime WASM runtime, and the landing page's measured stats — so `/screen` works
on a cold clone with nothing else to do. Expect a couple of minutes the first time and
about a second every time after.

Open the printed URL (default <http://localhost:5173>). Use **`localhost`**, not a LAN
IP — a secure context is required for the in-tab WebCrypto signature check and OPFS
storage.

> **Which signing key does local use?** The bundle under
> `frontend/app/public/bundle/origin/` is the committed *demo* bundle, signed with a
> throwaway demo key that is deliberately **not** the production trust root. So a local
> `vite dev` / `vite preview` server serves that demo verify key at `/public.key` and
> prints a line saying so on startup. The deployed site pairs the production bundle with
> the production pin in `frontend/app/public/public.key`; `vite build` copies that file
> into `dist/` untouched.

## 2. Screen a name (`/screen`)

Go to **`/screen`**. On first visit the page:

1. boots the **MiniLM** embedder once (cached after the first load),
2. syncs the committed **signed bundle** into the tab — it verifies the Ed25519
   `latest` pointer, content-addressed manifest and compressed chunks before parsing
   the materialized `catalog.json` and enabled lists (fail-closed — a tampered,
   oversized, stale, or unsigned artifact aborts the load),
3. is then ready to screen names across all enabled lists entirely in-tab.

Type a sanctioned-ish name (something close to a demo entry) and submit. You get a
**scored result with a `reasons[]` breakdown and a plain-language explanation** —
which name signals fired (name similarity, alias, country, DOB), how they rolled up
into the score, and which **source list** the match came from. Adjust the strictness
slider (Lenient / Balanced / Strict) to see the match threshold tighten. See
[`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md) for the scoring contract.

Beside each match score you'll also see a small **Verified** chip — the engine seals
every score it produces with a signed **score receipt**. Expand **Score receipt** on the
match card to see the full signed envelope: algorithm, signer key, payload hash,
signature, and the sealed score, tier, engine version, watchlist version, and inputs
hash. Prove it to yourself: the verdict is computed in your browser, offline, against
this install's own key — if the sealed data were altered in any way, the chip would read
**Not verified — tampered**.

## 3. Choose lists and sensitivity (`/settings`)

Go to **`/settings`** to configure the screening run. It persists to the local SQLite
`settings` table (not the server — there is no server):

- **Screening sensitivity** — Strict / Balanced / Lenient. This is the global match
  threshold; Strict surfaces fewer, higher-confidence matches.
- **Watchlists** — tick the lists to screen against (OFAC SDN, EU, UN, UK/OFSI). A list
  you disable drops out of future screens; its matches become `SUPPRESSED` on the next
  rescan.
- **Per-list overrides** — tighten or loosen the threshold for one list independently.
- **Analyst name** — stamped on the dispositions you record.
- **Clear cached lists** — drops the durable OPFS bundle cache; the next load
  re-fetches and re-verifies fail-closed.

## 4. Onboard a customer and work a match (`/customers` → `/review`)

The app is a small **local-first KYC workstation** on top of screening. Its store is a
SQLite-WASM database persisted in your browser's OPFS — local to the tab, no server.

1. Go to **`/customers`** and onboard a customer (name, and optionally country / DOB).
   The customer is **auto-screened on the spot** across all enabled lists; any hits are
   saved with the customer.
2. Go to **`/review`** to work the resulting matches. They are tiered
   (STRONG / POSSIBLE / WEAK) and carry a **Source** column naming the list. Use the
   **View filter** (All / Needs review / Changed only) to focus; open the per-match
   **History drawer** to read the audit trail; open a match, read its reasons, and
   **resolve** it with a reviewer note (e.g. true positive / false positive).
3. **Re-screen behavior.** When a list version advances (or you edit the customer), the
   match is re-screened. If nothing material changed, the match keeps your prior
   disposition and stays suppressed — you don't re-review it. If the matched entity's
   identity data changed, the match is flagged **CHANGED — needs re-review** (keeping the
   prior disposition) and shows up under "Needs review" / "Changed only". Every
   transition is appended to the `match_events` audit trail. Deleting that customer
   atomically removes the customer, matches, reviewer notes, and event history from the
   application database. The persistent connection enables SQLite `secure_delete` and
   disables reusable WAL journaling; browser/OS forensic remnants remain outside the
   app's guarantee, so clear this origin's site data for the device-level reset.

Everything — onboarding, screening, and the review decision — happens in the browser
against the in-tab database and the signed lists.

### Move customer tables between devices

On `/customers`, use **Import CSV/XLS/XLSX** to preview a customer spreadsheet before
committing it. Parsing stays local, accepts at most 10 MB / 5,000 rows, validates the
identity fields, skips duplicate references, and commits accepted rows in one SQLite
transaction before a serial re-screen. **Export XLSX** saves the customer table locally.
This spreadsheet is not a full backup: matches, audit events, settings, and the signed
watchlist cache remain in the browser and are not included.

## 5. Build a demo bundle

The repo already ships a committed **demo** bundle (the signed, content-addressed
distribution under `frontend/app/public/bundle/origin/` — the `latest` pointer +
`manifest/<hash>` + `chunk/<hash>` CAS) so `/screen` works on a cold clone. To rebuild it:

```bash
cd frontend
pnpm --filter @amlfilter/publisher run build-demo-bundle
```

This regenerates the signed `latest` pointer, the content-hashed manifest, and the chunk
store the browser delta-syncs (carrying `catalog.json` + each list's `entities.jsonl` /
`vectors.f32` / `meta.json`). For building lists from your own exports, and for refreshing
the live data, see [`DEPLOY.md`](DEPLOY.md) and the wire format in
[`WATCHLIST_FORMAT.md`](WATCHLIST_FORMAT.md).

## 6. Run the gate

Run the same canonical gate CI runs, from `frontend/`. It refuses to run on any Node
other than the exact `.nvmrc` version, because a gate green on a runtime CI never uses
is not evidence:

```bash
cd frontend
nvm use          # or: nvm install $(cat .nvmrc)
pnpm gate
```

This runs lint, strict typechecking, thresholded coverage, production builds, i18n
verification, and all three real-browser lanes. The golden parity tests guard the
in-browser scorer and tier classifier against their frozen reference output.

### End-to-end browser lanes

Three Playwright lanes drive the **real minified build** against the **committed signed
demo bundle** in real Chromium (from `frontend/app`):

```bash
cd frontend/app
pnpm test:e2e:c1     # the in-tab C1 screening lane (boot → verify → screen)
pnpm test:e2e:kyc    # the backend-free KYC journey: onboard → auto-screen → review → resolve
pnpm test:e2e:bundle # signed-bundle delta sync: verify → OPFS → offline reload
```

CI runs all three. A green build is **not** proof the app works — these lanes are the
guard that the actual demo bundle verifies and screens in a real browser.

## Production build + preview (browser-validation path)

To exercise exactly what ships (and what the e2e lanes drive):

```bash
cd frontend
pnpm --filter aml-filter-app build      # runs tsc --noEmit && vite build;
                                        #   a prebuild hook stages the same model
                                        #   weights, WASM runtime, and demo stats
pnpm --filter aml-filter-app preview    # serves the dist/ build; open the printed URL
```

## Troubleshooting

- **`/screen` never becomes ready** — it boots the embedder and verifies the signed
  watchlist bundle on first load; give the model fetch a moment on a cold cache, and
  confirm a clean browser console.
- **"Local screening engine unavailable" on a fresh clone** — check the terminal: the
  `dev` script stages the model weights and WASM runtime before Vite starts, and it
  fails loudly if a download or hash check fails. Re-run
  `pnpm --filter aml-filter-app dev`; it resumes and skips whatever is already staged
  and hash-correct.
- **"signature verification failed"** — verification is fail-closed by design. Serve the
  app through `pnpm dev` or `pnpm preview` (which pair the committed demo bundle with
  its demo verify key), over a secure context (`localhost` or HTTPS) — not a LAN IP, and
  not a bare static file server, which would serve the production pin against a
  demo-signed bundle. The same check runs over cached bytes, so a stale/corrupt cache
  also fails closed; use **Clear cached lists** in `/settings` to force a re-fetch.
- **No matches ever** — screen a name that's actually close to one on an enabled list
  (the committed demo lists are small), and confirm the list is enabled in `/settings`.
