// Model-download progress metered at the TRANSPORT, not at the library.
//
// WHY not transformers.js's own `progress_callback`: in 4.2.0 passing it makes
// `pipeline()` run a metadata pass over every expected file first
// (pipelines.js: `if (progress_callback) await Promise.all(expected_files.map(
// get_file_metadata))`). With this app's self-hosting config
// (`allowLocalModels = true`, `localModelPath = "/models/"`) that metadata probe
// is NOT a cheap Range request — `_get_file_metadata` sees a root-relative path,
// takes the local-file branch, and issues a FULL same-origin GET whose body it
// never cancels. The ~23 MB ONNX would be pulled twice on every cold boot.
//
// So progress is read off the bytes instead: for the duration of the model load
// the transformers.js `env.fetch` knob is wrapped, and any response for a
// self-hosted model asset has its body teed through a counting stream. The tee
// re-enqueues the SAME chunks, so the consumer receives byte-for-byte what the
// server sent; nothing is buffered twice and no request is repeated.
