// L2-normalization. transformers.js feature-extraction with

// `/models/Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2/onnx/model_quantized.onnx` — served same-origin
// instead of from the HF CDN. (In the browser the ONNX device is `wasm`; we pin
// dtype to the shared EMBEDDING_DTYPE (`q8`) EXPLICITLY rather than relying on the
// wasm device's implicit default, so the runtime deterministically requests the

// vectors in one embedding space; see nodeEmbedder.ts.)
//
// `useBrowserCache` is RE-ENABLED. The original `Ke(...).call is not a function`

// MINIFIED prod build in a real Chromium with the cache on and asserts ZERO
// in-page console errors as the ~23 MB model loads, so a re-introduction of the
