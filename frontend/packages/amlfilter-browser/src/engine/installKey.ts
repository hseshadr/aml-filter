// The per-install signing key behind the Avow score receipt.
//
// A receipt is only meaningful if the same installation signs with a STABLE
// key: that is what lets a reviewer pin one public key and later verify every
// receipt this browser profile ever produced. So the seed is generated once, on
// first use, and persisted; every later boot re-derives the same public key.
//
// Key-custody honesty (the same caveat scoreReceipt.ts carries): the seed is
// held in ordinary browser storage. Same-origin script can read it. This is a
// tamper-EVIDENT provenance record, not a hardware-backed key boundary. It
// proves a receipt was not altered after signing; it does not prove the host
// was uncompromised at signing time.
