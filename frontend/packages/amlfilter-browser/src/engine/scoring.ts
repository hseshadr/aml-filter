 * Preset weights/threshold.
 *
 * DIVERGENCE FROM THE PYTHON BACKEND, DELIBERATE. These used to be byte-for-byte
 * `aml_filter.scoring.config`. `alias_match` has been raised in all three
 * presets; nothing else moved. The Python source of truth is not in this
 * repository and has not been updated, so the two now differ until it is brought
 * across. Everything else about the port — signal order, tiers, descriptions,
 * the clamp — is unchanged.
 *
 * WHY. The live /screen page sends a combined-score floor of 0.30 (Balanced).
 * With `alias_match` at 0.10 an exact hit on a name OFAC itself publishes for
 * that entity contributed 0.10 — by arithmetic, below the floor. The signal
 * could never lift an entity on its own; it was decorative. An entity findable
 * ONLY through a published alias — the product's whole promise — scored as if
 * the alias did not exist. Balanced's 0.35 is set so one exact alias hit clears
 * 0.30 with margin and nothing else has to be true.
 *
 * WHY THE OTHER FOUR WEIGHTS DID NOT MOVE. Paying for the alias raise out of
 * `name_vector` would have LOWERED every score that has no alias hit, and the
 * preset thresholds (0.75 / 0.65 / 0.55) are calibrated against the old sums —
 * a perfect primary-name match would have stopped clearing its own preset. This
 * change is therefore purely additive: no (entity, query) pair scores lower than
 * it did, and only pairs with a real alias hit score higher.
 *
 * The consequence, stated plainly: the weights no longer sum to 1.0 (Balanced
 * sums to 1.25), so the score is a clamped weighted sum rather than a weighted
 * average, and a match strong on every signal at once saturates at 1.0 sooner
 * than it used to. That is the intended reading — five independent signals all
 * agreeing IS a 1.0.
 *
 * Across presets the ordering carries the levels' meaning: Strict trusts an
 * alias least (an alias is a weaker identity claim than a designation's own
 * name) and Lenient trusts it most.
