// Does the list selection actually reach the sync?
//
// It did not. `RuntimeSelection.enabledLists` existed and was honoured — but only
// in `#loadEnabledLists` / `#loadStreamingSources`, which run AFTER
// `openBundleSource` has already delta-synced the entire bundle. /screen has
// passed `enabledLists: ["OFAC_SDN"]` since it shipped and still downloaded EU,
// UK and UN on every cold boot: 527 of 1,296 chunks, 18.4 MB of 46.7 MB,
// measured against the live 2026-08-01 bundle.
//
// These tests assert the wiring at the seam where it was missing — what the
// runtime ASKS the bundle source for — rather than what the engine ends up
// holding, which was already correct and is exactly why nothing caught this.
