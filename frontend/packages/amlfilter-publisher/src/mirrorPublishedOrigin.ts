// mirrorPublishedOrigin — keep the last good signed bundle live when an
// upstream sanctions feed is unreachable.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. Cloudflare Pages deploys a whole directory: whatever is in
// `frontend/app/dist` becomes the site. The signed bundle is served from that
// same tree, so a deploy that omits it would take the watchlist offline. Before
// this module, `deploy.yml` deleted the served origin and rebuilt it from the
// four live feeds — meaning any feed outage (2026-07-30: Treasury's new AWS WAF
// 403ing our fetch) failed the job and froze the ENTIRE site, docs and all.
//
// WHAT IT DOES. Re-publish the bytes that are already live. It fetches the
// currently-served origin and re-verifies the complete trust chain — signed
// /latest pointer against the pinned public key, manifest content-address, and
// every chunk through the client's own zstd-decompress -> sha256 rule — then
// writes those EXACT bytes to the output tree.
//
// WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO. It never re-signs, never synthesizes a
// pointer, never relaxes a check, and never invents a fresher build date. The
// mirrored pointer keeps its ORIGINAL `version`, so the site continues to state
// the true age of the list it is serving. Nothing is written until every byte
// has verified, so a refused mirror leaves no partial bundle behind.
//
// FAIL-CLOSED CEILING. Serving the last good list is right for a bad afternoon,
// not forever. `maxServedAgeDays` caps how long that is acceptable; past it the
// mirror REFUSES and the deploy goes red, because a silently ancient sanctions
// list is worse than a loud failure. A pointer whose version is not a parseable
// date cannot be aged, so it is refused too whenever a ceiling is in force.
