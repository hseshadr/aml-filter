// buildRealBundle — the CI build step: fetch the REAL sanctions lists via the
// existing source adapters, embed their names with the Node MiniLM embedder,
// stage them with stageBundle(), then shell out to `edgeproc publish` to chunk +
// Ed25519-sign the staging tree into the content-addressed
// `origin/{latest, manifest/<hash>, chunk/<hash>}` layout the in-tab sync tier
// consumes. Every list must fetch, parse to a plausible non-zero count, and
// prove freshness — but each list is now refreshed, and therefore fails, on its
// OWN. A list whose upstream is unreachable is re-served from the bundle already
// published (verified end-to-end, marked stale, keeping its real age) so one
// flaky third party cannot age the lists that are healthy. It is still
// fail-closed where it counts: a list that can be neither refreshed nor proven
// from the published bundle aborts the publish rather than quietly vanish.
//
// Run from frontend/ (the publish CI does this) via the thin
// `buildRealBundleMain.ts` entry — this module is the importable library it
// drives (so the unit test can exercise stagedListsFromSources without running
// edge-proc or a live fetch):
//   pnpm --filter @amlfilter/publisher run build-real-bundle -- \
//     --key signing.key --version 2026-06-23 --sequence 123 --out <originDir> [--models <dir>]
//
// `edgeproc` is invoked via publishBundle(), which resolves the edge-proc
// checkout from EDGEPROC_DIR (the CI sets it to the installed edge-proc). The
// --key is the raw 32-byte Ed25519 production seed (decoded from the
// WATCHLIST_SIGNING_KEY secret); the produced /latest signature verifies in-tab
// against the committed public.key.
