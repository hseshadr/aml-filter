// The recall gate: compare a fresh measurement against the committed floors.
//
// The floors live in the committed baseline file, so raising them is a visible
// diff and lowering them is a visible diff. They ratchet UP only — a change that
// improves recall is expected to move the floor with it; a change that lowers
// recall fails here instead of shipping.
//
// TOLERANCE, and why it is not a fudge factor: the corpus vectors are produced
// by a quantized ONNX model, and its last-bit arithmetic is not identical across
// CPU architectures. Two entities whose scores differ in the fourth decimal can
// swap rank between an arm64 laptop and an x86_64 CI runner, so a floor pinned
// to the exact measured value would fail on a green tree. The tolerance is the
// width of that platform noise and nothing else; it is subtracted ONCE, when the
// floor is written, and the comparison here is exact.
