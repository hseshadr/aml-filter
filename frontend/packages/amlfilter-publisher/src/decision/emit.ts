// Screen every labelled query and every generated negative, and record what the
// user would have been shown.
//
// The screen call is INJECTED, exactly as it is in the recall harness, so this
// module is unit-testable against a fake engine with a handful of entities. The
// real run passes the production `ScreeningEngine.screen`.
//
// EXPECTED-BUT-MISSING IS EMITTED. When an entity that legitimately answers the
// query does not come back at all, a row is still written for it (`retrieved:
// false`, score 0). It is a true match the product did not show — a false
// negative — and a harness that only recorded what came back could not count it.
// That is the exact blindness this whole exercise exists to remove.
