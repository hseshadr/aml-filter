/**
 * scoped-sync-topup — the end-to-end guard for scoped list syncing.
 *
 * /screen defaults to OFAC SDN alone, but `syncIndex` used to walk every file in
 * the manifest, so a cold boot downloaded the EU, UK and UN directories too and
 * then never read them. Against the live 2026-08-01 bundle that was 527 of 1,296
 * chunks and 18.4 MB of 46.7 MB — roughly 40% of the first-use cost, spent on
 * data the page does not touch.
 *
 * Narrowing a fetch is only safe if enabling a list LATER still works, and works
 * incrementally. This spec asserts both halves against a real browser, a real
 * dedicated Worker, and real OPFS:
 *
 *   1. the cold boot requests OFAC's chunks and NOT the other lists';
 *   2. enabling EU in Settings fetches EU's chunks and re-fetches NOTHING that
 *      is already local.
 *
 * (2) is the load-bearing one. A scoped sync that "worked" by silently
 * re-downloading everything on every selection change would pass a naive
 * screenshot test and be worse than the bug it replaced.
 *
 * The fixture bundle is 13 chunks — one per file, four lists — so per-list
 * request counts are exact and readable rather than statistical.
 *
 * PROVEN ABLE TO FAIL: with `wantedPaths` dropped from `syncIndex`, step (1)
 * sees eu/uk/un chunk requests on the cold boot and fails.
