/**
 * rollback-recovery — a returning visitor stuck behind the anti-rollback floor
 * gets out IN-APP, with a warning and a confirm, never automatically.
 *
 * Since edgeproc-browser #13 the durable active pointer stays the rollback floor
 * even across a key change. A browser that once accepted a HIGHER sequence than
 * the origin now serves refuses every sync with a `RollbackError`, and the only
 * way out is clearing the cached lists — which must therefore be reachable from
 * the boot-failure card, must not need a successful sync first (the old clear
 * path synced before clearing, so it could never clear this state), and must
 * never fire on its own (an attacker who can serve an old signed pointer would
 * love an app that wipes the floor for them).
 *
 * The floor is seeded through the REAL sync path, not by poking storage: the first
 * visit is served the committed, genuinely signed demo-2 fixture (sequence 2),
 * which the Worker verifies and promotes. The second visit gets the committed
 * demo-1 origin (sequence 1) — a real rollback, refused by the real Worker.
