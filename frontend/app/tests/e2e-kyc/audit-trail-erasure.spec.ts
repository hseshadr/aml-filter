/**
 * e2e-kyc — the right to erasure still works now that `match_events` is
 * append-only IN THE DATABASE (schema v4).
 *
 * Why this needs a browser and not another unit test. The unit suite proves the
 * triggers against `:memory:`; this proves the same code against the real
 * opfs-sahpool VFS, which is browser-only and which the workstation package's
 * vitest config explicitly defers to Playwright. Two things can only fail here:
 *
 *   1. `migrate()` verifies `PRAGMA recursive_triggers` took effect and throws if
 *      it did not. That check runs on the persistent connection, after
 *      `configurePersistentPrivacy` has already changed journal_mode and
 *      secure_delete. If the pragma did not hold under OPFS, the workstation
 *      would fail to boot at all and every assertion below would fall over.
 *
 *   2. `deleteCustomer` now deletes the customer BEFORE its events, because the
 *      BEFORE DELETE trigger refuses any delete whose customer still exists.
 *      That ordering is the only sequence the database permits, so if it were
 *      wrong the delete would abort and the row would stay on screen — which is
 *      exactly what this test would catch.
 *
 * The customer is deliberately a sanctioned name that is screened and then
 * DISPOSITIONED first, so the ledger genuinely holds events (with a reviewer
 * identity and notes on them) at the moment of deletion. Erasing an empty trail
 * would prove nothing.
 *
 * Driven against the MINIFIED production build over the COMMITTED signed bundle,
 * per the CLAUDE.md browser-validation mandate. `http://localhost` is a secure
 * context — REQUIRED for OPFS.
