 * e2e-kyc — the LOCAL-FIRST KYC workstation journey, proven END-TO-END in a
 * real headless Chromium against the MINIFIED production build with ZERO
 * application backend: the watchlists are the committed signed BUNDLE
 * (app/public/bundle/origin: signed `latest` → content-hashed `manifest` →
 * `chunk/` CAS) verified against the pinned key, and KYC records live in
 * SQLite-WASM persisted to OPFS via the DB Worker.
 *
 * ONE Playwright-managed webServer: `vite preview` over a freshly built dist/.
 * The signed bundle + pinned pubkey are static public/ assets served same-origin.
 * The build sets no VITE_BUNDLE_BASE_URL, so the runtime defaults to /bundle/origin.
 *
 * `http://localhost` is a secure context — REQUIRED for OPFS (the sahpool
 * database) and WebCrypto verification. A LAN IP or host.docker.internal is NOT
 * a secure context and does not count as validation (CLAUDE.md
 * browser-validation mandate).
