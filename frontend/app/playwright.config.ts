/**
 * The default `vite dev` lane. Most specs here are exploratory and NOT gated.
 *
 * ONE spec in this lane IS gate-enforced: `tests/score-receipt-browser.spec.ts`,
 * run by `pnpm test:e2e:receipt` (app) which the canonical gate
 * (frontend/package.json) invokes by path. It is the real-Chromium proof that
 * backs the `@vitest-environment node` switch in
 * packages/amlfilter-browser/src/engine/scoreReceipt.test.ts — leaving jsdom is
 * only defensible while a real browser proves the same path, so that proof has
 * to execute on every gate run, not merely exist.
 *
 * WHY IT RUNS HERE INSTEAD OF IN A FIFTH LANE OR AN EXISTING ONE:
 *   • It cannot fold into the c1 / kyc / bundle lanes. Those serve a built
 *     `dist/` through `vite preview`, and the spec reaches the unbundled
 *     workspace module over `/@fs/<abs path>` — a DEV-SERVER-only route that
 *     does not exist under preview.
 *   • The mobile lane is the only other `pnpm dev` lane, but its contract is
 *     device-profile smoke across three device profiles; an Ed25519 crypto proof
 *     hosted there would mislead every future reader and misattribute failures.
 *   • This config already owns the spec (testDir `./tests`, and testIgnore
 *     excludes only e2e-c1/e2e-kyc), with the webServer and CI settings it
 *     needs. So the gate adds an invocation, not a fifth config — and its cost
 *     is one `vite dev` boot, with no `pnpm build`, making it the cheapest
 *     browser lane in the gate.
