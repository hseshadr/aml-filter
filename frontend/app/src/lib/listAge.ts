/**
 * How old a watchlist's data is, in words a person can act on.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS: the bundle refreshes each list independently. When an
 * upstream feed is down the publisher re-serves that list's last good copy and
 * marks it stale, keeping the instant it was ORIGINALLY fetched. So "the bundle
 * was built today" says nothing about how old any one list is, and an analyst
 * screening against a three-day-old EU list has to be able to see that number.
 *
 * Formatting goes through `Intl`, so the wording follows the viewer's locale
 * without a translation key per unit. The surrounding sentence ("updated {{age}}",
 * "Not updated for {{age}}") stays in the i18n catalogue.
