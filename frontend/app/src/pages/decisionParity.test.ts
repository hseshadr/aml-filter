// The decision harness measures at the thresholds THIS FILE'S neighbours define.
//
// frontend/packages/amlfilter-publisher/src/decision/ screens the frozen OFAC
// corpus and records, per (query, entity) pair, whether the user would have been
// shown it. Precision, recall, F1, FPR and FNR are then computed from those rows
// in Python. Every one of those numbers is a statement about `strictness.ts` —
// so if the harness's copy of the levels or of the gate drifts from the app's,
// the committed metrics describe a product nobody uses.
//
// The harness cannot import the app (it is a private, browser-typed package), so
// it carries its own copy. This test is the seam that makes the copy honest: it
// imports BOTH and drives them over the same cases. Two checks, and the second is
// the one that matters —
//
//   1. the level literals are identical, field by field;
//   2. the app's real `passesStrictness` / `partitionByConfidence` and the
//      harness's `isKept` / `isPrimary` agree on every case in a boundary grid.
//
// If this fails, the app changed the decision. Update
// packages/amlfilter-publisher/src/decision/{levels,decide}.ts to match and
// re-measure (`pnpm --filter @amlfilter/publisher run gate:decision`), because
// the committed floors describe the OLD decision until you do.
