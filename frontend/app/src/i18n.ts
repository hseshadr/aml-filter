/**
 * i18next initialization — bundled catalogs, no runtime fetch.
 *
 * Every translation JSON is imported STATICALLY below, so Vite bundles + hashes
 * them into the app chunk. The app never reaches the network for strings, exactly
 * like the rest of AML-Filter (OFAC screening, the KYC workstation, and delta-sync
 * all run in the tab, zero backend calls). That is "no backend", not "offline":
 * there is no service worker, so loading the page still needs the network.
 *
 * English is the authoritative baseline. Adding a locale is copy-paste: duplicate
 * `locales/en/` to `locales/<lang>/`, translate the values, and register it in
 * `resources` + `supportedLngs` below. The parity test (locales.parity.test.ts)
 * then auto-enforces that the new locale covers every en key — no test edit.
