// imports cleanly, but the dev server routes .mjs requests through the module
// pipeline and refuses to import files that live in public/ ("can only be
// referenced via HTML tags"). Serving them raw here keeps dev === prod: the
// embedder's `wasmPaths = "/ort/"` works on the dev server too, so even local
// dev never touches the jsDelivr CDN (house standard §8.1b). The request path is
// run through resolveOrtAsset, which rejects anything that escapes the staged
// /ort dir via `..` traversal (unit-tested in src/dev/ortDevAsset.test.ts).

// LOCAL-SERVER ONLY: serve the verify key that matches the bundle we actually serve.
//
// Two different Ed25519 keys are in play, on purpose:
//   • public/bundle/origin/  — the committed DEMO bundle, signed with the throwaway
//     demo key (packages/amlfilter-publisher/fixtures/demo-public.key).
//   • public/public.key      — the PRODUCTION trust root, deliberately NOT the demo
//     key (packages/amlfilter-publisher/src/signing.test.ts asserts they differ).
//
// A local `vite dev` / `vite preview` server can only ever serve the committed demo
// bundle, so it must serve the demo verify key at /public.key or the in-tab verifier
// fails closed and /screen never boots. That is exactly what happened on a cold
// clone: the browser fetched the prod pin, the demo bundle failed to verify, and the
// user got "Local screening engine unavailable" with no way forward. The e2e lanes
// hid it because each one opted in via an env var the documented human path never set.
//
// This is a LOCAL SERVER concern only, and it changes no shipped byte: `vite build`
// copies the real public/public.key into dist/ untouched, and the deploy workflow
// republishes the bundle signed with the PROD key — so the deployed site always pairs
// the production bundle with the production pin. The banner keeps it non-silent, so a
// trust root swapped under you is never something you have to infer.
